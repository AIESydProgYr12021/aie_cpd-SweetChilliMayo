# Black Hole

## Game Design Pitch
Black Hole is a simple board game with both players having numbers ranging from 1-10, the aim of the game is to fill 20/21 cells with both players' tokens while ensuring your tokens are the least exposed at the end. After all tokens are placed, there will be one cell left unfilled, this cell is the 'black hole' and any cells adjacent to it will be summed for each player, whoever has the least score wins the round.

## Concept statement  
The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.

## Target audience  
Age, gender, game or other relevant interests
Any age, Any gender (people who enjoy board games)

## Reference
Black Hole is a simple board game and I will be creating the digital version of this. The concept of the game will be identical to black hole but vfx and sfx will be used to enhance the experience.

## Player experience and game POV
The game aims to create a competitive but fun experience for both players. The players will experience a phase where they aren't sure on strategies when they first start playing, although after time, they will learn how to interact and compete against other players.

## Unique Selling Points
What makes your game stand out? How is it different from all other games?
The vfx will hopefully help the game stand out from the board game itself, and it would eventually support online gameplay, allowing friends to play together online (this is a stretch goal).

## Game Systems
## What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the player interact with?

## Interactivity
## How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Perceptual, ST Cognitive, LT Cognitive, Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing Moment‐by‐moment? How does the player move through the world?  How does physics/combat/etc. work?

## Game UI:
## A clear, professional‐looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.
